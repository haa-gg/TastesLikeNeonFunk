<h2>A clean, sharp, and functional site</h2>

<p><a href="http://actionroofing.net/">http://actionroofing.net/</a> was just a treat to work on. The goal we were given was to make something professional that shows off the roofing and siding work the company does. We used their existing color palette of red, black, white and gray tones to put together a set of mock ups which took only a couple sets of minor revisions before everybody was happy with the layout.</p>

<p>Coding wise, the site is built off JointsWP-- a really clean framework for WordPress themes that has Foundation baked into it right from the get go. The site makes use of the data equalizer feature in Foundation which allows you to generate divs of equal height via JavaScript which makes it more friendly to the older browsers than the newer JS-free flex options.</p>
