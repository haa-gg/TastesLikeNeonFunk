<h2>Ever want to know what is discussed in the U.N. when something crazy happens?</h2>

<p>The University of North Dakota put together a program to simulate that event shortly after Russia invaded Crimea and tasked me with putting together promotional materials that would reflect the tone.</p>

<p>When I think of an international crisis, I get a sharp sense of urgency, danger, and a lot of hard work ahead. I felt the sharp, contrasting colors brought out the urgency while the grit layer helped give it an impression of the danger many people face.</p>

<p>Tech wise, the piece was clean and simple. The fonts, U.N. logo, and solid colors for the background were all vectors which I then used Photoshop to add a layer of grit to using a hi-res grunge texture and a multiply filter.</p>
