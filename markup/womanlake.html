<h2>A remote Canadian hunting lodge up in Ontario</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.womanlakelodgecanada.com">Womanlakelodgecanada.com</a> has been through 3 face lifts since I took over work on the site way back when.</p>

<p>This round's goal was to more actively use all the awesome pictures and video footage the hunters and fishermen get when they travel up there.</p>

<p>The place this really shines is in the top area of the home page (better known as the hero region or jumbotron to web nerds). We have 4 slides using images and text I selected with the idea of showing off the wonderful memories made heere and the beastly fish dredged up from the depths of the surrounding lakes.</p>

<p>The biggest technical challenge was getting the video footage used on the first slide to not grind the site to a hault while it loads in which was accomplished by fine-tuning the resolution with a tool called <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> which lets you adjust every little detail of the video format... but it's used via command line so the usability leaves something to be desired...</p>
