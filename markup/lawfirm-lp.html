<h2>Law firm landing pages can have a great deal of dynamic content in them</h2>

<p>	The firms are also keen on looking dignified and professional so the pages can get to be quite a handful!</p> 

<p>If you want to see this puppy in action, check out:  <a href="http://designerofstuff.com/example-law-lp">http://designerofstuff.com/law-lp</a> and play with the device types to see all the responsive love put into the page.</p>

<p>Most of the exciting bits involving putting locations in different arrays does not get used here as we don't have addresses. However, we can swap the headline region by adding a ?camp=1 or ?camp=2 (<a href="http://designerofstuff.com/example-law-lp?camp=1">http://designerofstuff.com/example-law-lp?camp=1</a>) query to the end of the URL. We can also change out the geographic region from the default of "Minnesota" for something a bit more exciting like "Camelot" by adding a url query of ?geo=camelot (<a href="http://designerofstuff.com/example-law-lp?geo=camelot">http://designerofstuff.com/law-lp?geo=camelot</a>).</p>

<p>	Take a look at what the dynamic php tends to look like to render proper geographic and headline info:</p>
