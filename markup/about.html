<h2>I'm a big fan of tech, but that should be obvious from the rest of the site</h2>

<p>So I'll try to keep this part focused on everything but my technical work.</p>

<p>I've bounced between 4 different states (MN, CO, CA, and ND) growing up and landed back where I started in Minnesota. I am currently living in Minneapolis which is the first big city I've ever had the pleasure of throwing down a couch in a living room and declaring my residence. My life is much like the city-- complicated, lively, and filled with loud and unexpected noises.</p>

<p>Hobby wise, I am a down hill skier through and through... which is a little like being a hardcore surfer who is currently posted up in Idaho. I make it work though by heading out to Colorado at least once a year with friends and/or family to plummet down the slopes at speeds which could get us fined along most city streets and a few stretches of the interstate.</p>

<p>Having a sport only available a few fun filled days a year lets me have a slue of other ways to kill time. These range from jogging around Lake Calhoun to building a 14 foot tall medieval siege weapon called a trebuchet with quite a few more reasonable hobbies thrown in. I am a rabid fan of open world RPG's, old school Nintendo, fantasy books (ask me about King Killer Chronicles or Terry Pratchett!), and electronic dance music.</p>

<p>Outside of my interests, I am comically lost when it comes to organized team sports which gives my friends endless amusement.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, what makes me tick is snow, mountains, tech, and imagination.</p>

====================================

<h2>My imagination is pretty active to put it lightly</h2>

<p>Most of my hobbies and work focus on taking whatever is in my imagination (or someone else's) and turning it into something I can show to other people and everybody grooves on it. I read loads of sci-fi, fantasy, and computer geek fiction. Pair that with continuously digging through every digital art hub I can find (Behance, ArtStation, Advanced Photoshop, and a subreddit dedicated to pictures of the wildest monsters a person can imagine to name a few) and pretty much anybody would start to picture the strange but flippin' awesome stuff that is constantly rolling through my mind.</p>

<p>All that creative media fires me up and makes me want to contribute my own outrageously cool content to the world. All this energy grounds its self in the form of artwork, fun little apps, websites, and cocktails of 2 or more being served up for everybody's consumption.</p>

<h2>Art and tech aside...</h2>

<p>I'm not always making stuff, I mean that would be pretty rad but alas, I need other stuff in my life to recharge my creative batteries. I spend a good chunk of time gaming, skiing, and keeping up with friends and family. Gaming wise, I have a PC and a Nintendo Switch that I spend a good number of hours playing open world RPG's and team based arena shooter games. </p>
