<h2>I'm a big fan of tech, but that should be obvious from the rest of the site</h2>

<p>So I'll try to keep this part focused on everything but my technical work.</p>

<p>I've bounced between 4 different states (MN, CO, CA, and ND) growing up and landed back where I started in Minnesota. I am currently living in Minneapolis which is the first big city I've ever had the pleasure of throwing down a couch in a living room and declaring my residence. My life is much like the city-- complicated, lively, and filled with loud and unexpected noises.</p>

<p>Hobby wise, I am a down hill skier through and through... which is a little like being a hardcore surfer who is currently posted up in Idaho. I make it work though by heading out to Colorado at least once a year with friends and/or family to plummet down the slopes at speeds which could get us fined along most city streets and a few stretches of the interstate.</p>

<p>Having a sport only available a few fun filled days a year lets me have a slue of other ways to kill time. These range from jogging around Lake Calhoun to building a 14 foot tall medieval siege weapon called a trebuchet with quite a few more reasonable hobbies thrown in. I am a rabid fan of open world RPG's, old school Nintendo, fantasy books (ask me about King Killer Chronicles or Terry Pratchett!), and electronic dance music.</p>

<p>Outside of my interests, I am comically lost when it comes to organized team sports which gives my friends endless amusement.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, what makes me tick is snow, mountains, tech, and imagination.</p>
