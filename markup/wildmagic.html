<h2>Need a 10,000 random magical effects for a D&amp;D game?</h2>

<p>Gotcha covered!</p>

<p>There's this thing called the Wild Magic Surge table which crops up occasionally in a given game of Dungeons and Dragons which causes about 50 differing magical effects such as shielding yourself or exploding but it has a cooler big brother with 10 thousand possibilities! Thing is this list is kind of a pain, selecting a random event from 10,000 possibilities is a bit of a hassle with just normal dice.</p>

<p>Enter my web app you can check out <a href="https://haa-gg.github.io/Improbability-Drive/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Click the big friendly button and get your wacky new spell effect!</p>

<h2>How's it work?</h2>

<p>So glad you asked, dear reader. All it does is read a local JSON file containing the 10,000 magical effects, pick one at random, and feed it into the spot where {EFFECT POPS UP HERE} starts off.</p>

<p>It's bloody simple and doesn't get much more user friendly than that.</p>
