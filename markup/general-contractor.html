<h2>Midas is not a real company</h2>

<p>But I like to imagine they would be quite happy to use this as a landing page on their AdWords campaign.</p>

<p>The goal is to give the impression of quality service without going overboard and coming off too spendy. I think I hit a nice middle ground with lots of neutral tones and a classy set of bathroom photos all in the same color palette.</p>

<p>Functionality wise, we have strong reasons to trust the company above the fold and a solid call to action above the fold as well. As the viewer scrolls down, they get more reasons to trust the company followed by another call to action in the form of a contact form I am quite proud of!</p>

<p>Overall, one of my favorite pieces for blending style and function in a way that leaves me and the client very happy!</p>
